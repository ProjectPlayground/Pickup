# Pickup
Sports pickup game matchmaking service, created for Hack the Valley 2017

The Android Project is incomplete and not functional due to our lack of experience, so [we provided mock-up images of what it would look like](https://github.com/gravitybear/Pickup/tree/master/mock-ups) and we also [created an interactive mock-up of our app](https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/8B9Y73VCR#/screens)
